# Project Title

A concise title representing the project's purpose or focus. For example: *"Data Analysis and Visualization with Python"*.

---

## Introduction

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates various data analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques using Python. It covers tasks ranging from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to the implementation of machine learning models, with detailed explanations and code snippets.

---

## Features

- Comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations.
- Implementation of machine learning models.
- Evaluation of model performance with metrics.

---

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   bash
   jupyter notebook
   
4. Open the file 102203268_Vardhan_Singh_Rawat.ipynb.

---

## Usage

1. Load the necessary libraries and datasets as mentioned in the notebook.
2. Execute the cells sequentially to:
   - Preprocess and clean the data.
   - Visualize patterns and distributions.
   - Train and evaluate machine learning models.

## Code Sections

### 1. Data Loading
Snippet for importing datasets and libraries:
python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns


### 2. Data Cleaning
Example:
python
# Handling missing values
data.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)


### 3. Visualization
Example:
python
sns.barplot(x='column1', y='column2', data=data)
plt.show()


### 4. Machine Learning Models
Example:
python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)


---

## Output and Visualizations
The notebook includes detailed visualizations and model performance metrics:
- *Heatmaps* to identify correlations.
- *Bar plots* for category distributions.
- *Confusion Matrices* and *classification reports* for model evaluation.
